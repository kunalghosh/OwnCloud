Problem 1: If a file modification is made in server , it is sync'ed to the client (using the stock Funambol fsync example client).
	But a modification in the client is not sync'ed to the server :(

Solution 1: The server is now able to propagate changes made in the server to the client as well as changes made in the client are
	saved in the server and old revisions of the file are saved as timestamped versions.

Problem 2: The data exchange is not very efficient, if a file is change the complete file is sent again not the diff alone :(

Problem 3: When a sync uses <MoreData> tag when a file is split across multiple xml files, then IMO the server doesn't 
	send a success response after </final> and so the client ends with "Synchronization error: Server Failure: server returned error code -1"
	
Problem 4: In files.php exists_item() It must verify the hash of the two files if they exist and return a different response code (maybe -2)
to indicate that the files have a same name but different hashes.

NOTE: 
1. (ref: problem 3) The problem doesn't occurr when large (1 MB) text files are sent. so the problem is most likely related to binary
files.
2. (ref: problem 3) The problem occurrs when large binary files are sync'ed. The error occurr after the last file (after the binary file)
the last file can be binary or text.
3. (ref: problem 3) Error seems to occurr somewhere in the finalization step of sync , only when dealing with binary files.
